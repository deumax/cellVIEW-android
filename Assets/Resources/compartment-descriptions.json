These integrative models combine atomic information from structural biology with ultrastructural information from microscopy, using proteomic information as a bridge. This model includes a mature HIV virion surrounded by blood plasma, built with CellPack. These types of models are used by researchers to develop and test basic hypotheses about mesoscale structure and function. For instance, similar models of HIV were used to interpret fluorescence data that probed the distribution of envelope glycoproteins on the surface of the virus, which is important in recognition of the cells that the virus infects."
